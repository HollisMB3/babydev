Entry level projects from school and study notes. 
'Hello Curious Person!'

This is my introductory letter introducing my introduction to the digital halls of learning things and stuff!

I actually started my journey in Web Development in the 90's building sites in HTML and later progressed to learning some PHP, FTP, Wordpress and currently own two domains. It is however, my love of robots and electronics hobbies is really what has lead me here.

I'm uncertain as to where this will all lead.
Might this land a good job?
Perhaps that dream will also become a reality, but that prospect hasn't quite set in yet.
My goal started as a desire to design, build, and program, my own micro controllers and UI to be installed in my own tools, e.g. drones, camera controls, or robots. Most of this is really an exercise I wanted to commit to to keep my own sanity and to give my mind something to focus on that is disciplined and organized.

In short, although I am not prone to spiritual ideas I am here learning for the sake of "fun" and to benefit my own "soul".

Be prepared, my approaches may be unorthodox.
My notes may be filled with stupid jokes or sarcasm.
I will try to keep the offenses limited.

For now as "Groot stick babydev" I am studying javascript.
I will move onto machine learning at a later date since Javascript is my current obsession.

Thank you for reading.
I hope this entertains and maybe helps someone learning "stuff that is new" to them.
